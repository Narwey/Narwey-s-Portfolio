                <p className='mt-6 md:text-sm text-xs text-[#71717A]'>I'm Anouar Benmbark, a 24-year-old full-stack developer with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. After my degree, I joined a bootcamp where I mastered the MERN stack (React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) and developed projects, including a blogging platform with user interaction features and an admin interface, and a marketplace for artisans to sell handmade products securely online. I then interned as a frontend developer at UP2CAREER, further enhancing my skills. Noticing the demand for PHP Laravel in Morocco, I completed a Simplon training in Laravel and Vue.js, during which I built projects like a weather app and a recruitment platform. I'm now seeking a role to apply my skills in a dynamic company.</p>
